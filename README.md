- **`rowspan`**: Merges cells across multiple rows.

## 2. Ordered List 📋

An ordered list is used to display items in a specific order. The `<ol>` element is used for this purpose.

## 3. Unordered List 🔘

An unordered list is used to display items without a specific order. The `<ul>` element is used for this purpose.
